# Services

The integration provides a service to manually refresh departure data.

## openpublictransport.refresh_departures

Manually refresh departure data from the API outside of the normal update interval.

### Description

This service triggers an immediate API call to fetch the latest departure information. Use this when you need up-to-date data without waiting for the next scheduled update.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `entity_id` | No | Specific entity to refresh. If omitted, all entities are refreshed. |

### Examples

#### Refresh All Sensors

```yaml
service: openpublictransport.refresh_departures
```

#### Refresh Specific Sensor

```yaml
service: openpublictransport.refresh_departures
data:
  entity_id: sensor.openpublictransport_dusseldorf_hauptbahnhof
```

#### Refresh Multiple Sensors

```yaml
service: openpublictransport.refresh_departures
data:
  entity_id:
    - sensor.openpublictransport_dusseldorf_hauptbahnhof
    - sensor.openpublictransport_essen_hauptbahnhof
```

### Use Cases

#### Button Card for Manual Refresh

Create a button in your dashboard to manually refresh data:

```yaml
type: button
name: Refresh Departures
icon: mdi:refresh
tap_action:
  action: call-service
  service: openpublictransport.refresh_departures
  service_data:
    entity_id: sensor.openpublictransport_dusseldorf_hauptbahnhof
```

#### Automation: Refresh When Arriving Home

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Refresh departures when arriving home"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: person.john
        to: home
    action:
      - service: openpublictransport.refresh_departures
        data:
          entity_id: sensor.openpublictransport_dusseldorf_hauptbahnhof
```

#### Automation: Refresh Before Morning Commute

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Refresh departures before commute"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "07:00:00"
    condition:
      - condition: time
        weekday:
          - mon
          - tue
          - wed
          - thu
          - fri
    action:
      - service: openpublictransport.refresh_departures
        data:
          entity_id: sensor.openpublictransport_dusseldorf_hauptbahnhof
```

#### Script: Refresh and Notify

```yaml
script:
  refresh_and_notify_departures:
    alias: "Refresh and Notify Departures"
    sequence:
      - service: openpublictransport.refresh_departures
        data:
          entity_id: sensor.openpublictransport_dusseldorf_hauptbahnhof
      - delay:
          seconds: 2
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "Next Departure"
          message: >
            {{ states('sensor.openpublictransport_dusseldorf_hauptbahnhof') }} -
            {{ state_attr('sensor.openpublictransport_dusseldorf_hauptbahnhof', 'next_departure_minutes') }} min
```

### Rate Limiting Considerations

!!! warning
    While the refresh service bypasses the normal update interval, it still counts against the daily API rate limit.

- Each refresh counts as one API call
- The integration tracks daily API calls
- If the rate limit is reached, refreshes will fail
- A repair issue will be created if rate limiting is triggered

### Best Practices

1. **Don't call too frequently** - Give time for API response before triggering again
2. **Use in specific scenarios** - Arriving home, before leaving, etc.
3. **Combine with normal updates** - Don't rely solely on manual refreshes
4. **Monitor API usage** - Check the diagnostics for call counts

## openpublictransport.get_journeys

Return every connection a trip sensor is currently holding, each with its legs.

### Description

A trip sensor publishes the legs of the first connection and no more than a summary of the alternatives — departure, arrival, duration, transfers, transfer risk. That is deliberate: every attribute is written to the recorder on each state change, and carrying the legs of four connections would roughly triple what a trip sensor stores. The detail is not missing, though, only unpublished: the coordinator keeps every connection whole between polls, and this action hands it over.

It costs no request to the provider. It also cannot disagree with what the sensor is showing — the connections have already had the departed ones dropped and the entry's line and transport-type filters applied, which a fresh `plan_trip` would not have.

This action returns a response, so it must be called with `response_variable` (in the UI: *Actions → openpublictransport.get_journeys*, then enable the response). Calling it without one is rejected rather than silently doing nothing.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `entity_id` | Yes | The trip sensor to read. A departure board is rejected — it has no journeys. |

### Example Call

```yaml
action: openpublictransport.get_journeys
data:
  entity_id: sensor.trip_station_to_station
response_variable: trip
```

### Response

The same journey structure `plan_trip` returns, for every connection the sensor holds — the one in the sensor's own attributes first, then the alternatives:

```json
{
  "journeys": [
    {
      "departure": "09:42",
      "arrival": "10:21",
      "departure_timestamp": "2026-09-20T09:42:00+02:00",
      "arrival_timestamp": "2026-09-20T10:21:00+02:00",
      "duration_minutes": 39,
      "transfers": 1,
      "connection_feasible": true,
      "transfer_risk": "low",
      "min_transfer_time": 6,
      "legs": [
        {
          "origin": "Nürtingen",
          "destination": "Wendlingen (Neckar)",
          "line": "RB63",
          "direction": "Stuttgart Hbf",
          "product": "Regionalbahn",
          "transport_type": "train",
          "departure_planned": "09:42",
          "departure_estimated": "09:46",
          "arrival_planned": "09:50",
          "arrival_estimated": "09:54",
          "delay": 4,
          "duration_minutes": 8,
          "platform": "2",
          "transfer": "Fussweg",
          "transfer_minutes": 6
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

An empty list means the sensor has no connections to offer — either the provider found none, or its last update failed, in which case the entity is unavailable anyway.

### Matching a Journey

`departure_timestamp` identifies a connection across calls; the position in the list does not, because the first connection rolls off as it departs. A caller that showed a summary earlier and wants its detail now should look the journey up by that timestamp and say so plainly when it is no longer there, rather than fall back on an index and describe a different connection.

## openpublictransport.check_delays

Check for delayed departures and fire an `openpublictransport_delay_alert` event.

### Parameters

service: openpublictransport.check_delays
data:
  entity_id: sensor.openpublictransport_dusseldorf_hauptbahnhof
  delay_threshold: 5
  line: "U79"
```

### Response

Returns a list of delayed departures. Additionally fires an `openpublictransport_delay_alert` event with:

          message: >
            {{ trigger.event.data.delayed_count }} delayed departure(s).
            Max delay: {{ trigger.event.data.max_delay }} min.
            Lines: {{ trigger.event.data.lines | join(', ') }}
```
